This  thesis  proposes  a  novel  deep  learning-based  ap-proach for adaptive Canny edge detection (CED).Edge detection is an essential component of many com-puter  vision  tasks.  Prosthetic  vision  for  example,  aimsto restore vision in patients with the help of an implantwhich converts digital information into brain signals. To improve  this  technique  we  aim  to  automate  the  thresh-old  selection  usually  done  manually  for  such  an  edgedetection application. This is accomplished by exploringthe  possibility  of  a  deep  neural  network  learning  theoptimal hysteresis threshold values to use in Canny edgedetection for a given input image.The approach in this thesis consists of a prediction modelwhich  is  trained  using  a  three-model  pipeline  with  asurrogate  network  and  a  validation  model  to  select  theoptimal threshold values for a given image.The   surrogate   model   shows   sensitivity   to   differentthreshold-sets  similar  to  the  CED  and  thus  provides  adifferentiable substitute. A classifier and an autoencodershow  good  initial  results  in  giving  a  performance  in-dication  on  the  resulting  contour-image.  These  resultsopen up the possibility to train a range of prediction andvalidation  model  combinations  on  the  surrogate  model,and  give  an  indication  of  which  validation  methodsshould be explored in the future.
